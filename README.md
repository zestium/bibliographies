# Bibliographies

This repo is used to store bibliographies on knowledge graph, conversational agent, and related references. It is meant to be processed by [BibLaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) or [BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex). The file format is `.bib`. 

The bibbliographies are groupped into two:

1. **State of the art**, around 5 years before 2021 until now (2021).
2. **Classic works**, older but influential references.
